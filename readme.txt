VidSplit is a Python script to automate splitting mp4s and mp3s into smaller chunks by a time interval using ffmpeg.

It accepts three arguments: the file path, the duration of the smaller chunks (in seconds) and the total duration (in seconds). So if your video, located at Documents/myvideo.mp4, is one hour long and you want it split into one minute chunks, enter the following into your command line:

python vidSplit.py Documents/myvideo.mp4 60 3600
